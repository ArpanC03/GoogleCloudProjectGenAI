# AI Career Advisor With Offline Large Language Models

## Project Description

This project is an AI-powered Career Advisor designed to provide personalized career guidance for students and early professionals. It uses offline large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, and DialoGPT via the Hugging Face Transformers library, ensuring privacy by running without any cloud APIs or accounts. The system incorporates a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model trained on a synthetic skill-to-career dataset to recommend careers based on user skills. Users interact through a console menu to select their preferred career path and receive detailed AI-generated advice on required skills, challenges, and growth opportunities. The system also provides insights on emerging AI trends and integration possibilities related to the chosen career, with comparative information about alternative careers. The project is fully open-source, privacy-focused, and zero-cost, suitable for students and AI enthusiasts.
